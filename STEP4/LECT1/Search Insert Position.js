//it is same as lower bound code --- so refer that

//my mind also says that
// a element can be inserted between lower and upper bound without distorting the sorted array
//see the example [1,2,2,3,4]   for x =2 LB is at index 1 and upper bound is at index 3 so
//x can be at both the indices without distorting the array
